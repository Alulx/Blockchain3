# Sample Hardhat Project

This project demonstrates a basic web3 use case. It comes with a sample contract, a test for that contract, and a script that deploys that contract and a Frontend to run the application inside

## Quick start
run npm install to get all needed packages 

you might need to manually install svelte-web3: npm i svelte-web3

In order to run the Frontend you need to run the following commands in the root directory of the project:

cd Frontend

npm run dev

```
